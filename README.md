# Tetrisudoku

Tetrisodoku is a game combining the famous game Tetris and Sodoku. With each move the player can chose between three Tetris tiles which he can drag and drop anywhere on the game board. Once one of the marked squares on the gameboard is completely filled, the blocks disappear and make room for new tiles to place. On top of that the respective score will be credited (the darker the tile, the more points it gives). The game is over when none of the tiles can be placed on the board any more.

A running version can be found [here](https://muellermarius.github.io/tetrisudoku/).
